                    <p class= "oneTen" onclick="clickThroughStory('.oneTen','.oneEleven')">After I had a little rested my weary body, I took my way again along that deserted slope, so that my halted foot was always the lower.</p>
                    <p class="oneEleven" onclick="clickThroughStory('.oneEleven','.oneTwelve')">And behold, almost at the beginning of the steep, a leopard, light and very swift, covered with spotted fur;</p>
                    <p class="oneTwelve" onclick="clickThroughStory('.oneTwelve','.oneThirteen')">and it did not depart from before my face but rather so impeded my way that I was at several turns turned to go back</p>
