## The Challenge

Dante’s classic work, La Divina Commedia (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_Comedy>) is considered one of the great works of literature - exploring the worldview and philosophy of the time.

A modern audience might find the text dense and hard to grasp.

Below is a short excerpt. It is from the very beginning of the work (Inferno, the first book).

The challenge is to present this text so a modern audience would find it engaging and be able to follow Dante’s themes (if you are not sure of themes see Canto I - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(Dante>))

Use only HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap 5 (<https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/>).

As a starting point, you may wish to store text in an array and use some of the bootstrap features for interactivity.

You may also wish to think about how you can communicate the emotional themes.

Bonus points for including some responsive capabilities.

There is no right way - this is completely subjective and hopefully a bit of fun.

Feel free to ask any question about this task or anything else.

### Notes

So what the inferno is mostly about is contemporary politics - Dante is having trouble working out what to do with his life. He meets Virgil (the Roman) who tells him that heaven has decided to give Dante a guided tour or hell and purgatory. many of the people he meets on the tour were still alive at the time, but dante places them in hell depending on what he sees as their sins.

to make it relevant to a modern audience, they need to understand the politics he was living through, as well as the actual language - crude and violent

### The Divine Comedy - Inferno (Abstract)

Midway upon the journey of our life
I found myself within a forest dark,
For the straightforward pathway had been lost.

Ah me! how hard a thing it is to say
  What was this forest savage, rough, and stern,
Which in the very thought renews the fear.

So bitter is it, death is little more;
  But of the good to treat, which there I found,
  Speak will I of the other things I saw there.

I cannot well repeat how there I entered,
  So full was I of slumber at the moment
  In which I had abandoned the true way.

But after I had reached a mountain's foot,
  At that point where the valley terminated,
 Which had with consternation pierced my heart,

Upward I looked, and I beheld its shoulders,
  Vested already with that planet's rays
 Which leadeth others right by every road.

Then was the fear a little quieted
  That in my heart's lake had endured throughout
 The night, which I had passed so piteously.

And even as he, who, with distressful breath,
  Forth issued from the sea upon the shore,
 Turns to the water perilous and gazes;

So did my soul, that still was fleeing onward,
  Turn itself back to re-behold the pass
 Which never yet a living person left.
